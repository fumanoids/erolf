 1. INTRODUCTION
-----------------

The communication to and from the servo motors used to be a major cause of
trouble. The FUmanoid robots use Dynamixel servo motors which communicate
via an RS485 interface. In order to increase the communication performance
a realtime communication unit was developed.

The following describes the major features of the board.


 2. PROCESSORS
--------------

There are two stm32f505 (ARM Cortex M4) processors embedded in the 
board. The first processor - processor1 - is dedicated to the 
communication to the motors.

The second processor - processor 2 - is dedicated to processing the 
IMU values but can be used for motion execution and planning as well 
since the computation of the orientation leaves lots of resources free.

For the documentation/manuals of the processors please consider visiting
the manufacturers homepage (http://www.st.com/).


 3. COMMUNICATION TO THE MOTORS
--------------------------------

One processor is dedicated for the communication to the servo motors. It
handles up to three transactions (read command and reply or write command)
at the same time while processing those information. By using three RS485
busses very high communication rates can be achieved (about 10000 operations
per second max).

Reading of values (eg. position, speed and torque) in the motors is done
automatically in order to collect those data and to tranfer one single packet
containing all motor values to a main computing unit. 

When the processor receives a packet from the main computer containing values
to write to the motors it schedules those write operations and processes them
in a real time fashion.


 4. IMU
--------

The second processor is dedicated to an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and
for data processing. An extended kalman filter is implemented which updates
at about 1000Hz and distributes the board's orientation to the main computing
unit at about 200Hz.

The sensors used are a LSM303DLHC (accelerometer and magnetometer) and 
a L3GD20 (angular rotation sensor). Documentation for the sensors can be
found at the manufacturers homepage (http://www.st.com/)


 5. COMMUNICATION TO MAIN COMPUTING UNIT
-----------------------------------------

A main computing unit can be attached via a UART interface.

The integrated level shifter allows all voltage levels from 1.8V to 5V on this
interface with communication rates up to 1M Baud.

A protocol for communication is already implemented inside the framework to
deliver packets or messages in a really little-code-generating manner.


 6. SAFETY FUNCTIONS
---------------------

The most frequent cause of electrical failure in the motors happened when the
voltage supply wire touched a data wire resulting in a overvoltage which
destroyed most ICs connected to the data bus. Those events are hard to foresee
or to prevent since the whole cabling of the robots has to be checked.

To prevent any damage caused by such an event a power cutting mechanism is
implemented in this board. Whenever a data wire carries more than a certain
voltage (adjustable via Zenner-Diode) the supply voltage to the motors is cut
off via a P-MOSFET. The power supply can be reenabled by writing a 1 into a
d-FlipFlop but will be cut immediately when the overvoltage condition occurs
again. 

The delay between the occurence of the error condition and the cutting of the
supply voltage is about 200ns.

This safety feature can be disabled by software in case you do not need it or
if you experience trouble with it.

The electronic safety of the motors can be further enhanced when incorporating
the FUmanoid's power supply board and further overvoltage-protection-boards
(so called Schlückies).

 7. SD MEMORY
--------------------------------

There is a micro SD Card slot attached to processor 2 wich can be used
to store motions for execution on the board itself.


 8. BUZZER
--------------------------------

A piezo buzzer can be used to generate sounds either in a wave generation
fashion where two frequency profiles and frequencies can be added. 
It is also possible to play souds stored on the SD Card.


 9. BUTTONS
--------------------------------

Up to five buttons can be attached to a connector for use as user input.
You can even use Buttons with embedded LED which can be used for debug
information or state signaling.

Toggling of the LED does not affect the input capabilities of the buttons.
